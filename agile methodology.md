### "Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid. 
It’s just so tempting to draw up endless charts. All the work needed to be done on a massive
project laid out for everyone to see—but when detailed plans meet reality,
they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change,
discovery, and new ideas.
### Inspect and Adapt. 
Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing,
review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and
if you can do it better.
### Change or Die.
Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and
control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the
competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust.
### Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early. 
Corporate culture often puts more weight on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation that can
be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not produce real
value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user
feedback and you can immediately eliminate what is obviously wasteful
effort. " - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>
### "Hesitation Is Death. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. 
Know where you are, assess your options, make a decision, and act!
### Look Outward for Answers. 
Complex adaptive systems follow a few simple rules, which they learn from their environment.
### Great Teams Are. 
They are cross-functional, autonomous, and empowered, with a transcendent purpose.
### Don’t Guess. Plan, Do, Check, Act. 
Plan what you’re going to do. Do it. Check whether it did what you wanted. Act on that and change how you’re
doing things. Repeat in regular cycles, and, by doing so, achieve continuous improvement.
### Shu Ha Ri. 
First, learn the rules and the forms, and once you’ve mastered 
them, make innovations. Finally, in a heightened state of mastery, discard the
forms and just be—with all the learning internalized and decisions made
almost unconsciously." - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>


### "Pull the Right Lever. 
Change Team performance. That has much more impact—by several orders of magnitude—than individual performance.
### Transcendence. 
Great teams have a purpose that is greater than the
individual; e.g., burying General MacArthur, winning the NBA
championship.
### Autonomy. 
Give teams the freedom to make decisions on how to take action
—to be respected as masters of their craft. The ability to improvise will
make all the difference, whether the unit is reporting on a revolution in the
Middle East or making a sale.
### Cross-functional. 
The team must have every skill needed to complete a
project, whether the mission is to deliver Salesforce.com software or
capture terrorists in Iraq.
### Small Wins. 
Small teams get work done faster than big teams. The rule of
thumb is seven team members—plus or minus two. Err on the small side.
### Blame Is Stupid. 
Don’t look for bad people; look for bad systems—ones
that incentivize bad behavior and reward poor performance.
" - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>



### "Time Is Finite. Treat It That Way. 
Break down your work into what can
be accomplished in a regular, set, short period—optimally one to four
weeks. And if you’ve caught the Scrum fever, call it a Sprint.
### Demo or Die.
At the end of each Sprint, have something that’s done—
something that can be used (to fly, drive, whatever).
### Throw Away Your Business Cards. 
Titles are specialized status markers.
Be known for what you do, not how you’re referred to.
### Everyone Knows Everything. 
Communication saturation accelerates work.
### One Meeting a Day.
When it comes to team check-ins, once a day is
enough. Get together for fifteen minutes at the Daily Stand-up, see what can
be done to increase speed, and do it.
" - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>



### " Multitasking Makes You Stupid. 
Doing more than one thing at a time
makes you slower and worse at both tasks. Don’t do it. If you think this
doesn’t apply to you, you’re wrong—it does.
### Half-Done Is Not Done. 
A half-built car simply ties up resources that could
be used to create value or save money. Anything that’s “in process” costs
money and energy without delivering anything.
### Do It Right the First Time. 
When you make a mistake, fix it right away.
Stop everything else and address it. Fixing it later can take you more than
twenty times longer than if you fix it now.
### Working Too Hard Only Makes More Work. 
Working long hours doesn’t
get more done; it gets less done. Working too much results in fatigue, which
leads to errors, which leads to having to fix the thing you just finished.
Rather than work late or on the weekends, work weekdays only at a
sustainable pace. And take a vacation.
### Don’t Be Unreasonable.
Goals that are challenging are motivators; goals
that are impossible are just depressing.
### No Heroics.
If you need a hero to get things done, you have a problem.
Heroic effort should be viewed as a failure of planning.
### Enough with the Stupid Policies. 
Any policy that seems ridiculous likely
is. Stupid forms, stupid meetings, stupid approvals, stupid standards are just
that—stupid. If your office seems like a Dilbert cartoon, fix it.
### No Assholes.
Don’t be one, and don’t allow the behavior. Anyone who
causes emotional chaos, inspires fear or dread, or demeans or diminishes
people needs to be stopped cold.
### Strive for Flow. 
Choose the smoothest, most trouble-free way to get things
done. Scrum is about enabling the most flow possible.
" - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>



### "It’s the Journey, Not the Destination.
True happiness is found in the
process, not the result. Often we only reward results, but what we really
want to reward is people striving toward greatness.
### Happy Is the New Black.
It helps you make smarter decisions. Plus, when
you’re happy, you’re more creative, less likely to leave your job, and more
likely to accomplish far more than you ever anticipated.
### Quantify Happiness.
It’s not enough just to feel good; you need to measure
that feeling and compare it to actual performance. Other metrics look
backward. Happiness is a future-looking metric.
### Get Better Every Day—and Measure It.
At the end of each Sprint, the
team should pick one small improvement, or kaizen, that will make them
happier. And that should become the most important thing they’ll accomplish
in the next Sprint.
### Secrecy Is Poison.
Nothing should be secret. Everyone should know
everything, and that includes salaries and financials. Obfuscation only
serves people who serve themselves.
### Make Work Visible. 
Have a board that shows all the work that needs to be
done, what is being worked on, and what is actually done. Everyone should
see it, and everyone should update it every day.
### Happiness Is Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. 
Everyone wants to
control their own destiny, get better at what they do, and serve a purpose
greater than themselves.
### Pop the Happy Bubble. 
Don’t get so happy that you start believing your
own bullshit. Make sure happiness is measured against performance, and if
there is a disconnect, be prepared to act. Complacency is the enemy of
success.
" - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>



### "Make a List. Check It Twice. 
Create a list of everything that could
possibly be done on a project. Then prioritize it. Put the items with the
highest value and lowest risk at the top of that Backlog, then the next, and
then the next.
### The Product Owner. 
She translates vision into Backlog. She needs to
understand the business case, the market, and the customer.
### A Leader Isn’t a Boss. 
A Product Owner sets out what needs to be done
and why. How the team accomplishes it and who accomplishes it is up to the
team.
### The Product Owner: 
Has knowledge of the domain and the power to make
final decisions. He or she is available to answer questions and is
accountable for delivering value.
### Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA).
See the whole strategic picture,
but act tactically and quickly.
### Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.
It’s better to give than to receive. Get inside
your competition’s OODA loop and wrap them up in their own confusion.
### Get Your Money for Nothing, and Your Change for Free.
Create new
things only as long as those new things deliver value. Be willing to swap
them out for things that require equal effort. What in the beginning you
thought you needed is never what is actually needed.
" - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>



### "Scrum Accelerates All Human Endeavors. 
The type of project or problem
doesn’t matter—Scrum can be used in any endeavor to improve
performance and results.
### Scrum for Schools.
In the Netherlands, a growing number of teachers are
using Scrum to teach high school. They see an almost immediate
improvement in test scores of more than 10 percent. And they’re engaging
all sorts of students, from vocational to gifted.
### Scrum for Poverty. 
In Uganda, the Grameen Foundation is using Scrum to
deliver agricultural and market data to poor rural farmers. The result:
double the yield and double the revenue for some of the poorest people on
the planet.
### Rip Up Your Business Cards.
Get rid of all titles, all managers, all
structures. Give people the freedom to do what they think best and the
responsibility to be accountable for it. You’ll be surprised at the results.
