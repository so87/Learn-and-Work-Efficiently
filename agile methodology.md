### "Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid. 
It’s just so tempting to draw up endless charts. All the work needed to be done on a massive
project laid out for everyone to see—but when detailed plans meet reality,
they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change,
discovery, and new ideas.
### Inspect and Adapt. 
Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing,
review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and
if you can do it better.
### Change or Die.
Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and
control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the
competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust.
### Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early. 
Corporate culture often puts more weight on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation that can
be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not produce real
value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user
feedback and you can immediately eliminate what is obviously wasteful
effort. " - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>
### "Hesitation Is Death. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. 
Know where you are, assess your options, make a decision, and act!
### Look Outward for Answers. 
Complex adaptive systems follow a few simple rules, which they learn from their environment.
### Great Teams Are. 
They are cross-functional, autonomous, and empowered, with a transcendent purpose.
### Don’t Guess. Plan, Do, Check, Act. 
Plan what you’re going to do. Do it. Check whether it did what you wanted. Act on that and change how you’re
doing things. Repeat in regular cycles, and, by doing so, achieve continuous improvement.
### Shu Ha Ri. 
First, learn the rules and the forms, and once you’ve mastered 
them, make innovations. Finally, in a heightened state of mastery, discard the
forms and just be—with all the learning internalized and decisions made
almost unconsciously." - (Sutherland, JJ (2016) </br>
