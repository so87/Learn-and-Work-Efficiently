Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid. It’s just so tempting
to draw up endless charts. All the work needed to be done on a massive
project laid out for everyone to see—but when detailed plans meet reality,
they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change,
discovery, and new ideas.
Inspect and Adapt. Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing,
review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and
if you can do it better.
Change or Die. Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and
control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the
competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust.
Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early. Corporate culture often puts more weight
on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation that can
be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not produce real
value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user
feedback and you can immediately eliminate what is obviously wasteful
effort.
